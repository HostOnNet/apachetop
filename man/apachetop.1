.TH apachetop 1  "February 13, 2004" "version 0.10" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
apachetop \- display real-time web server statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apachetop [-f filename] [-H hits | -T time] [-q] [-l] [-s segments] [-p] [-r secs]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ApacheTop watches a logfile generated by Apache (in standard common or
combined logformat, and generates human-parsable output in realtime.
.OPTIONS
.TP
-f logfile
Select which file to watch.
Specify this option multiple times to watch multiple files.
.TP
-H hits | -T time
These options are mutually exclusive. Specify only one, if any at
all. They work as follows. ApacheTop maintains a table of
information internally containing all the relevant information about
the hits it's seen. This table can only be a finite size, so you
need to decide how big it's going to be. You have two options.
You can either:
Use -H to say "remember <this many> hits"
or	Use -T to say "remember all hits in <this many> seconds"
The default (at the moment) is to remember hits for 30 seconds.
Setting this too large (whichever option you choose) will cause
ApacheTop to use more memory and more CPU time. My experimentation
finds that remembering no more than around 5000 requests works well.
.TP
-q
Instructs ApacheTop to keep the querystrings, not remove them.
.TP
-l
Instructs ApacheTop to lowercase all URLs, thus /FOO and /foo are
treated as the same and accumulate the same statistics.
.TP
-s segments
Instructs ApacheTop to only keep the first <segments> parts of the
path. Trailing slashes are kept if present. Statistics are then
merged for each truncated url.
.TP
-p
Instructs ApacheTop to keep the protocol (http:// usually) at the
front of its' referrer strings. Normal behaviour is to remove them
to give more room to more useful information.
.TP
-r secs
Set default refresh delay, in seconds.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
apachetop -f /var/logs/httpd/access.log
