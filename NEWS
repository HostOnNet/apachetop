ApacheTop NEWS - Recent major changes

v0.12.5
 * Threading is no longer used. Everything now runs in a single thread.

v0.12
 * Add FAM support; event notification for Linux etc.
 * Add adns support; ApacheTop can now resolve your IPs into Hosts.
    Please give me feedback on this; it's not very widely tested.
    You'll need to use the cmdline switch -r to enable it.
 * Add return code breakdown for each item. Press 'n' while running.
 * Header now converts to GB/MB/KB/Bytes where appropriate.
 * TAKE NOTE! Commandline option changes:
     -r for refresh delay has changed to -d
     -r has been re-assigned to enable resolving of hosts/ips.

v0.11
 * Add Filters, with optional regexp (pcre) support. Press 'f' while running.
 * Add configure option --with-logfile.

v0.10
 * Fix intermittent crash bug when there is nothing to display.
