ApacheTop TODO & Wishlist

Before next release:
* FAM error checking / file recreation / deletion
  * watch for a file being recreated and reopen it


Short term:
* served content footprint; add up size of each unique object in the circle
  and display it; nice little indicator of how much unique webcontent is
  being used
* per object stats; breakdown of return codes for a single object
* improve url-chopping (/browse/something -> /browse) to be definable in
  realtime; involves storing entire url, not munging at storetime, and then
  doing munging in display routine.
* add a new display summarising hits/bytes per logfile
* more munging; chop off first parts of hosts, so 
    p11112-adsah09honb5-acca.tokyo.ocn.ne.jp  becomes
    .tokyo.ocn.ne.jp   then   .ocn.ne.jp   then   .ne.jp

Medium term:
* remove dependencies on readline and (n)curses

Long term:
* Apache module possibility, rather than tailing a logfile
* more logformats; custom atop format (include time taken for request etc)?
